Title: Late night reminder
<p>Hey there, guys.<br/><br/>If you’re up right now browsing the internet or looking for some positivity before trying to sleep, I just wanted to give you a littler reminder.<br/><br/>YOU are important. Really, you are. I know it’s hard to believe sometimes, and that self doubts can make it very difficult to let it sink it.<br/><br/>That still doesn’t change that it’s true! You are important, and you matter. Things might be hard right now, but I promise that it won’t always seem so dark. It’s worth holding on, because there is a future before you full of possibilities and opportunities to help make your goals come true.<br/><br/>~C</p>

We don’t have a working phone, so he couldn’t get in contact with his family at all. All of the stores nearby were also without power and the busses weren’t running, so we couldn’t even go get him something.

Title: You don’t need to be able to draw to be an artist
<p>Art isn’t always a 1 on 1 copy of a real life concept, or even a concept at all.</p><p>Things like Paint Pouring, String Pulling, and Hydro Dipping do not require any sort of drawing what so ever, but are still absolutely beautiful works of art.</p><p>Sculpting doesn’t require the need to draw. Pottery doesn’t either. Both of these things are also beautiful artistic representations.</p><p><b>The next time you want to try an artistic outlet, don’t let “I can’t draw” be a reason not to.</b></p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>
</blockquote>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Without your support and knowing this blog helps so many people, we would likely be in a much tougher position than the one we’re in now.</p><p>You have all saved us from being homeless again multiple times. You’ve saved us when we’ve needed animal supplies, or pillows, or even headache meds&hellip; You’ve all shown us such kindness over the years and I truly wish I could pay it back.</p><p>And even during this crisis, y’all have come through for us.</p><p>There is kindness in the world. Running this blog has taught me that. Each person who takes the time to send in a reason, or reblog one, like one&hellip; even just read the reasons: you are taking the time out of your day to be kind to yourself, and to others. And I’m proud of you, and so very, very appreciative of all of the work you have all done!</p><p>Thank you all so much~ We love you!</p><p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>

Title: A Plea for Help
<p><a href="https://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/post/631250046552309760/a-plea-for-help" class="tumblr_blog">randomreasonstolive</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hello there, our dearest stars~</p><p>We both want to say, from every part of our hearts; THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!</p><p>Every time in the past we’ve asked for help y’all have come through for us. This time not only did you come through, but you showed us with overwhelming support that things WILL be okay.</p><p>THANK YOU so much to the people who donated and thank you, thank you, thank you~ to the people who bought us pet food!! as well as other things off our amazon wishlist! Seeing those things arrive had me, personally, in tears from relief, because knowing our animals are taken care of means more than knowing I’m taken care of, imo.</p><p>We love you all SO MUCH and we really hope you have a good weekend~ We know we will now, thanks to you!</p><p>- N</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello there you beautiful, shining stars,</p>
<p>For those of you who are new, our names are C and N and we are the admins of this blog!</p>
<p>We are a disabled queer couple and have been together ten years as of the end of October. We’ve got three cats, a stubborn doggo, and two crested geckos!</p>
<p>C and I have been hit hard by the pandemic, like most people have been in the USA (where we come from). We’ve been doing everything we can to make the stimulus money we were given last, but as we get into winter, it’s run out. We’re not sure if there will be another one, and when it could be, and we’re concerned we won’t be able to make it much longer. On top of that, our apartment building is increasing it’s rent in December by another $50, when we can’t afford the current price.</p>
<p>C had been trying to find a local job, but C’s immune system is compromised and both of us were scared that he would catch it. And… <b>he did</b>. Now we’re both dealing with covid on top of other struggles and it’s just… it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Asking y’all for help is something we usually avoid doing, because the idea of monetizing this blog hurts our hearts. But we also know we need to be able to admit when we’re in need.</p>
<p>And… <b>we’re in need of help, loves.</b></p>
<p>If you’d like to directly donate to us, <b>our paypal is</b>: teamcibby@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you’d prefer to get something for your donation,<b> I sell art commissions </b>on my art tumblr, <a href="https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/">https://tiny-pastel-unicorn.tumblr.com/</a> You can see my <b>examples for said art here</b>: <a href="https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b">https://sta.sh/21f0h7yv2y9b</a></p>
<p>We also have an<b> amazon wishlist</b> if you’d prefer that: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/16FH3EUB5XMPN?ref_=wl_share</a></p>
<p>Any amount of help is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>

If y’all could just… see the energy C puts into this blog… he spends night after night, when he could be playing Minecraft or watching Bailey Sarian, filling up the queue and making sure it lasts. Because he doesn’t want y’all to come on tumblr, hoping to see a reason, only for the queue to be empty. He puts that above himself on a daily basis.<br/></p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate what y’all have done for our blog and us in the past, in the present, and we know we will appreciate anything in the future. Without all of you and your support, we would have been lost a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>We love you all so much and we hope your October goes well~</p>
<p>- N</p>
